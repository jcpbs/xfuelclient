## Setting up MacOS Development Environment ##

#### Development on MacOS requires xcode command line tools:
*run "xcode-select --install" in Terminal*

#### Set correct command line tools in XCode preferences:
*Xcode - Preferences - Locations - Command Line Tools - Select version*

#### If you had Qt installed before installing command line Tools you might need to reinstall QT or figure out how to fix QT environment in that case
